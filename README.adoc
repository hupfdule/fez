What is Fez

Currently the following classes are provided by Fez:

Require:: Helper class for checking method parameter values.
ResettableTimer:: Timer class that allows resetting the time for the next
execution.
NamedThreadFactor:: A ThreadFactor that allows specifying a name prefix for
easier identification of created threads. This is mainly to be used with an
ExecutorService
Trigger:: A simple Trigger class to trigger some execution.


Prerequisites

Fez has no runtime dependencies on other libraries.

Fez can be used with Java 6 or higher.
